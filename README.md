Hello Im Ayaan if youre wondering 
so recently i was attending a coding bootcamp at 2412 robototes!
the bootcamp was to teach us of the basics of java
and i think i did pretty good.
my mentors Joseph and Connor were very kind and understanding
due to them in 4 days i made substansial progress 
from a beginner to advanced.
this is all my code and i hope you like it mom and dad
:)
